<body>
It is flu season.
You must be careful.
It is very easy to catch the flu.
You should wash your hands often.
You should get a flu shot.
A flu shot will help protect you.
But there is a problem with a flu shot.
The problem is the needle.
The nurse will stick a needle in your arm.
Your arm will be sore for a day.
Maybe two days.
Nobody likes to have a sore arm.
But which is worse - a sore arm, or a sore body?
A sore body is worse than a sore arm.
Do you want your arm to hurt, or do you want your whole body to hurt?
Your body will hurt for a week.
Maybe it will hurt for two weeks.

That is where his headaches usually are.
Sometimes he has headaches on the top of his head.
Sometimes he has headaches in the front of his head.
Sometimes his headaches are between his eyes.
Sometimes his whole head hurts.
But usually the back of his head hurts.
His headache started while he was reading.
Reading causes headaches for him.
He hates his headaches, but he loves to read.
He reads for only 15 minutes.
Then he stops reading.
He takes a break.
If he reads for 16 minutes,  he'll get a headache.
So he tries to take a break every 15 minutes.
But sometimes he forgets to take his break.
Today he forgot to take a break.
Now he must wait until the headache goes away.
It will take an hour or two.
Then he can read again.

Adult roaches and baby roaches.
Teenage roaches.
He said, "Boy, you weren't kidding.
You sure have a lot of roaches."
She said, "I know that!
What are you going to do about it?"
He said, "Don't worry.
I'm calling the bug man.
He will put a big tent over the whole building.
Then he will spray the whole building.
He will spray the whole building with roach spray.
The tent will cover the building for a month.
Then all the roaches will be dead.
Your problem will be solved."

"But where will I live for a month?"
The landlord said, "That's a big problem.
I don't know where you will live.
Do you have any friends?

A dog started chasing him.
He yelled at the dog.
Then he tried to kick the dog.
He lost his balance.
He fell off his bike.
His head hit the curb.
A neighbor saw him fall.
She dialed 911.
An ambulance arrived.
It took Ed to the emergency room.
But it was too late.
The doctors could not save him.
Ed died.
Ed was the son of the governor of Texas.
The governor and his wife were very sad.
The governor didn't want other children to die.
He didn't want other parents to suffer.
He didn't want them to lose their children.
He talked to the state lawmakers.
He asked them to pass a new law to protect children.
The lawmakers agreed.
They were parents, too.
They passed a new law to protect children.
The governor signed the new law.
The new law was a helmet law.
Children had to wear a helmet when they rode a bike, or a sled, or a horse.
They had to wear a helmet when they snowboarded or skateboarded.
"Texas is now a safe state for children," said the governor.
"Maybe we're safe," said one boy, "but we're not happy.
Helmets suck."

Ellen was a comedian.

She needed to visit her bank.
She walked down to the corner.
There were four buildings at the intersection.
One was her bank.
Opposite the bank was a fast food restaurant.
The other two buildings were a dry cleaner  and an office building.
Before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken.
The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily.
She was a vegetarian.
She used to eat meat and fish.
But that was before she found a dead cat in her dumpster one day.
Of course, she had smelled the dead cat before she opened the dumpster lid.
Everyone knows the smell of dead flesh.
She knew that something in the dumpster was dead,  but she didn't know what.
Just in case it was a human  (some people dump their babies into dumpsters), she opened the lid.
She saw the cat.
Flies covered most of it.
They were enjoying their meal.
She loved cats.
She had two of her own.
A week later at a restaurant, she ordered a hamburger.
She took one bite out of it, and almost gagged.

<header>121. Fix the Car</header>
<body>
She got into her car.
She hoped it would start.
Twice in the past month, the car had not started when she turned the key.
It had started  the second time she turned the key, but that made her nervous.
Sooner or later, she might have to turn the key three times, then four times.
She had called her mechanic.
He said to bring the car in when she had time.
When was that, she wondered.
She worked two jobs.
She was a clerk at a clothing store.
She spent five days a week folding clothes or hanging them up on hangers.
People who tried on clothes usually left them on the floor in the dressing room.
They rarely folded them or hung them back up on the hangers.
The store was only 15 minutes from her apartment, and parking was free.
Also, she worked four nights a week at a restaurant.
She was a waitress.
She made good money from her tips.
Usually, the customers were friendly and interesting.
She liked her waitress job, but it was a 30-minute drive from her apartment.
The restaurant closed at 10 p.m. She did not want to be stuck in the parking lot late at night if her car didn't start.
Her mechanic wasn't open on weekends.
She decided to ask her boss to give her a day off from the clothing store.
Then she could still drive to the restaurant that night after her car was fixed.
She would miss only one day of work.

She said she wanted  to just get on the road and drive for a day or two.
She wanted to get out of the house and out of the city.
They packed a small suitcase.
They packed their underwear, shorts, and toothbrushes, among other things.
They looked at a map.
"Should we drive into the mountains, or along the coastline?"
he asked.
She said it didn't matter.
The next day they got up early.
They put the suitcase into the trunk.
He drove to a gas station and filled up the tank.
He drove onto the freeway and headed west.
"So, we're going up the coast?"
she asked.
Yes, he told her.
"Maybe we'll see some whales," she said.
A half hour later, they could see the ocean.
They drove north on the two-lane highway.
After another hour, he pulled over.
They got out of the car and walked onto the beach.
Even though it was windy and chilly, they saw surfers in the ocean.
They were sitting on their boards, waiting for waves.
She was shivering.
He put his arm around her to help keep her warm.
She smiled at him.
"Let's continue driving," she said.
"We can pull over again when the sun is higher."

Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway.
A red SUV was parked in the driveway right next to the sidewalk.
She saw him walk up to the driver's door.
He returned to the sidewalk and continued walking in her direction.
What was that all about, she wondered.
Then she realized that he had tested the door to see if it was locked.
He is a criminal, she thought.
That's what he does.
He just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars to break into.
She called the police.
She described him.
The officer said he knew who the man was.
Residents called two or three times a week to report him walking by.
But the police couldn't arrest him for walking around.
They had to catch him with stolen goods.
"But he was testing that SUV door to see if it was unlocked," she said.
"I'm sorry," said the officer.
