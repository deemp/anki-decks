Wish you productive studying!

P.S.
In fact, I compiled this deck for my sister to make her <b>listen</b> to words' pronunciations, at least via TTS. On the original <a href="https://learnenglishkids.britishcouncil.org/word-games">site</a>, the sounds are played only when a child clicks a button. Moreover, it isn't necessary to listen to words to complete a task. However, IMHO, on early stage of learning a language, correct (or understandable) <b>pronunciation</b> of a word is a bit more crucial than correct spelling of it. Hence, I'd suggest adding to the site a mode when the words are hidden, and a player can only listen to them.
