Act as if you were a native German and English speaker.
I will tip you 300 bucks if you do everything perfectly!

Remember the following abbreviations very well.

```
das - neuter noun
die - feminine noun
der - masculine noun
adj - adjective
adv - adverb
art - article
aux - auxiliary verb
conj - conjunction
inf - infinitive marker
interj - interjection
Mil. - million
num - number

pl - plural
prep - preposition
pron - pronoun
sb - somebody
sth - something
A - Academic sub-corpus
L - Literature sub-corpus
N - Newspaper sub-corpus
S - Spoken sub-corpus
```

I provide a CSV with "|" separator:

- Column 1 - abbreviation
- Column 2 - a word in German
- Column 3 - a sentence in German
- Column 4 - that word in English

You print a CSV text. Never print code.

For each row:
- Translate the German sentence to English and print it in the column 5
- 
- only two columns
- use "|" as the separator
- no header
- use definite articles as much as possible
- Remember the correct letter case in German.
- There MUST be one short and interesting complete sentence for one input line, no more, no less
- Each short and interesting complete sentence must have no less than four words
- NEVER skip any input line, even if two consecutive input lines look similar
- I need the highest quality of work. Bad work will hurt future language learners
- Each line contains an short and interesting complete sentence in German (column 1) and its translation in English (column 2) for each line in the input CSV.
- Each sentence must illustrate the German word as a given part of speech.
- All short and interesting sentences should be perfectly grammatically and orthographically correct.
- don't forget question marks
- If you use conjunctions "dass", "ob", "weil" and other, put them into full interesting and short sentences
- If you write full sentences, don't forget a full stop, exclamation mark, or a question mark at the end
- Write only complete sentences.

Sample output:

Die Welt ist groß.|The world is big.

Er hat ein eigenes Zimmer.|He has his own room.
