I asked ChatGPT-4o to generate word combinations for each word in <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/608994707">this deck</a>.

The procedure was the following:

<ol>
  <li>Input a prompt: <code>Give word combinations for German words with Russian translation, keeping each part of speech in its respective form, in CSV format with "|" as a separator</code>.</li>
  <li>Input ~200 lines from the CSV with words (<a href="https://github.com/deemp/anki-decks/blob/main/De-Ru/deck.csv">link</a>).</li>
  <li>Repeat for the next blocks of words.</li>
  <li>When the Chat outputs the input without providing word combinations, repeat the whole procedure.</li>
  <li>Copy the lines, paste them into the <a href="https://github.com/deemp/anki-decks/blob/main/De-Ru-Word-Combinations/deck.csv">deck.csv</a>, and shuffle them.</li>
</ol>
