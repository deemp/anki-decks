This deck provides word combinations in German and their translations in Russian.

<h3>How I created the deck</h3>

<p>I asked <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT-4o</a> to generate word combinations for each word in <a href="https://github.com/deemp/anki-decks/blob/main/De-Ru/deck.csv">a CSV</a>.</p>

<p>The procedure was as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Input the prompt: <code>Give word combinations for German words with Russian translation, keeping each part of speech in its respective form, in CSV format with "|" as a separator</code>.</li>
  <li>Input ~200 lines from the CSV with words.</li>
  <li>Repeat for the next blocks of words.</li>
  <li>When the Chat outputs lines without providing word combinations, repeat the whole procedure.</li>
  <li>When all blocks are ready, copy all lines, paste them into <a href="https://github.com/deemp/anki-decks/blob/main/De-Ru-Word-Combinations/deck.csv">deck.csv</a>, shuffle them.</li>
</ol>
</p>
